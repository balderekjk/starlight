## Aloha mai kākou,

</div>

We continue to finalize the conference agenda and are looking forward to returning to Maui for the 25th annual NHEA conference. This year's conference will be held on March 21 and 22 at UH Maui College. The first NHEA conference was hosted at Maui College, 25 years ago. Last year NHEA had a one day in person conference after being virtually held for 3 years. This year we return to our normal format of a two day conference.

The theme for this year's conference is Hoʻoulu ʻia, Hoʻolau ʻia, Hoʻohua ʻia (to grow, mature, and produce) Building on Our Resilience to Sustain Community. The theme brings focus to the tragic wildfires that occurred on Maui and we look to them to learn about rebuilding and regenerating communities.

## The manaʻo behind the graphic, from its kumu

Grow, mature, and produce. Building on our collective resilience to sustain our community. Our community is sustained (grows, matures and produces) by aloha, ike, access to aina, water and so much more.

- the ulu tree using the shape of the leaf and fruit as the base.
- the older and younger generation with the honi, being a community, taking care of each other, sharing knowledge
- fresh water resources in the top of the leaf with tributaries that flow to the sea and a healthy reef
- mountain resources and lei
- weaving traditions: weaving is a part of many traditional disciplines, this is a part of many Hawaiian innovations
- kalo: connecting and maintaining connections to Haloa
